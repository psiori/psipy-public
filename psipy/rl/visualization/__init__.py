"""Visualization suite for control related tasks

This module contains visualization callbacks and methods that create plots
for control tasks such as reinforcement learning or PID control.  It includes methods
to plot SART hdf5 files written from the SARTWriter, and Keras callbacks to monitor
training of NFQ/NFQCA and other Keras-based control algorithms.
