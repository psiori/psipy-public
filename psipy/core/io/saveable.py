"""Saveable, a flexible baseclass for saveable python objects.

Core functionality for saving and loading classes. Focus on flexibility: All
different types of models should be saveable in a unified way, no matter
which library was employed when creating them.

Most end-user functionality is provided through
:mod:`~psipy.core.io.memory_zip_file`. See that documentation for further details
on what data can be stored inside a :class:`Saveable`.

Also refer to :mod:`psipy.core.io.saveable_sklearn`.

Example:

    >>> class Model1(Saveable):
    ...     def __init__(self, arg1=1, arg2=2):
    ...         Saveable.__init__(self, arg1=arg1, arg2=arg2)
    ...
    ...     def _save(self, zipfile):
    ...         return zipfile.add("config.json", self.get_config())
    ...
    ...     @classmethod
    ...     def _load(cls, zipfile):
    ...         config = zipfile.get("config.json")
    ...         return cls.from_config(config)
    >>>
    >>> class Model2(Saveable):
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         Saveable.__init__(self)
    ...         self._submodel = Model1()
    ...
    ...     def _save(self, zipfile):
    ...         zipfile.add("config.json", self.get_config())
    ...         zipfile = self._submodel.save(zipfile)
    ...         return zipfile
    ...
    ...     @classmethod
    ...     def _load(cls, zipfile):
    ...         instance = cls.from_config(zipfile.get("config.json"))
    ...         instance._submodel = Model1.load(zipfile)
    ...         return instance
    >>>
    >>> import tempfile
    >>> filepath = os.path.join(tempfile.mkdtemp(), "model.zip")
    >>> _ = Model2().save(filepath)
    >>> model = Model2.load(filepath)

    Usage: Inherit from this class, implement the :meth:`_save` and

    Inside :meth:`save` the primary method one uses is likely
    :meth:`MemoryZipFile.add <psipy.core.io.memory_zip_file.MemoryZipFile.add>`.
    That method guesses the fileformat by inspecting both the passed object
    (second argument) as well as the filepaths's (first argument) extension.
    The supported formats are the following:

    - ``tf.keras.Model``: ``.h5``

    - ``Dict[str, np.ndarray]``: ``.npz``

        This method is primarily called in two cases: On the top level from a
        library user who wants to load an instance from disk and then
        recursively within the loaded class' ``load`` method for sub-instances.
        On the top level this method is called using a filepath (:class:`str`),
        on the lower level using a :class:`MemoryZipFile` instance.

        There is a third special case where one would directly want to pass a
        top-level :class:`MemoryZipFile` instance, for example when loading the
        :class:`MemoryZipFile` bytes from a database.

        If zipfile is a string, the zip is opened and expected to contain a
        folder of the same name as the zipfile's filename. This is ensured by
        this method and handled the same by :meth:`save`.

                support calling this method again from within a :meth:`_load`
                implementation.
            name: Name of the Saveable to load. By default, the calling class'
                name (``cls.__name__``) is used. This argument specifies the
                subdirectory of the zipfile's current working directory to
                load the model from.
            custom_objects: Keyword argument currently without behaviour on its
                own, but passed further down to submodel's protected
                :meth:`_load` methods when they expect it. Relevant when a

                versions less of a hassle as long as one is confident that his
